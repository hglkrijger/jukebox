# Jukebox

Recently, my wife had the great idea of printing a song card for our 16 month old toddler. After a few days of continuous singing, I decided to build a jukebox for her instead. This is a quick walkthrough for anyone who might like to do the same.

In addition to this, I also needed to purchase some songs to play, which were ~$1 each. 

Total cost: ~$100 with some extra parts left over.

## Case

I designed the outer case and trim using Tinkercad, and printed in two colors. You can find all those parts here:

- [Back](case/01%20-%20grey%20-%20back.stl)
- [Front](case/02%20-%20grey%20-%20front.stl)
- [Red trim](case/03%20-%20grey%20-%20decoration.stl)
- [Grey trim](case/04%20-%20red%20-%20decoration.stl)
